# sqlalchemy-challenge


This one was a tough one for me. 

I have the climate_starter filled out with all the code and think it is all correct.

I have 2 files that are almost identical because one was done on jupter notebook which I though ran fine but then I could not get it to open an html. I then copied the code 
inputted it into python code and ran it and kept getting errors. I am not sure why it wont open up, but when I run it without opening the database on Python
it does open up.

Anyways, I know this is late but wanted to have something in.

Thanks,
